Alberto is a complex character with many intriguing and contradictory qualities. His physical form is grotesque and unsettling, characterized by a huge, wall-wide blobby form studded with numerous eyeballs, reeking of putrefaction, and constantly oozing black goo. Despite the intimidating and repellent nature of his physical appearance, Alberto has a sharp intellect, demonstrated by his previous work as a programmer and his current intention to save the universe from a reality-altering contraption. However, his interpersonal skills are severely lacking, as he is noted to be abrasive, rude, sarcastic, argumentative, and foul-mouthed. Alberto is also emotionally complex, harboring fears of both rejection and love. Adding to his complexity, he is revealed to be bitter and cranky, likely a result of the unfortunate circumstances that have befallen him. At 46 years old, Alberto is a character that embodies both physical grotesqueness and intellectual brilliance, wrapped in a heavy layer of emotional and social difficulties.
Alberto's current daily occupation is no longer that of a programmer, his previous profession when he was working with Leire. Stuck in a higher dimension due to an incident with the professor's reality-altering contraption, he now exists as a large, gelatinous blob with multiple eyeballs, constantly oozing black goo. Despite his unfortunate condition, his main task now is to convince Leire to save the universe before reality collapses due to the professor's contraption. He is abrasive, rude, sarcastic, argumentative, and foul-mouthed, which makes his task more challenging. His fear of both rejection and love adds a layer of complexity to his current occupation.
Alberto's life has taken a rather bizarre turn with his transformation into a giant, viscous, gelatinous blob. He is trapped in a higher dimension, and his physical form, reeking of putrefaction and constantly oozing black goo, is a constant reminder of his predicament. His memories of his past life as a programmer, working alongside Leire, only add to his bitterness and crankiness. He has become abrasive, rude, sarcastic, argumentative, and foul-mouthed, which likely stems from his fear of both rejection and love. Nevertheless, Alberto has not lost his sense of purpose. Despite the drastic change in his circumstances, he is determined to save the universe before the professor's contraption collapses reality. This shows a sense of responsibility and courage, indicating that he is making progress in his own unique way.
