Name: Leire (age 30)
Leire is a complex individual with an array of distinct characteristics. She is obsessive compulsive, autistic, anxious, unhinged, perverted, fatalistic, and masochistic. These traits arguably stem from her troubled past with abusive and neglectful parents, which has impacted her ability to relate to others and her self-worth.

Her social interactions are marked by a strong distaste for most humans, with Alberto being a notable exception whom she finds particularly annoying and repulsive. Despite her dislike for humans, she has formed a close bond with her girlfriend Jacqueline, who acts as a mother figure to her, and her adopted daughter Nairu. Leire also carries a fear of loud noises and regrets, as well as an irrational fear of anthropomorphic creatures. She works as a software engineer, which might be reflective of her analytical mind.
